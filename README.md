<p>
Expanding human vision with AI solutions!
Year 2021. We are facing more and more life and environment threatening situations (eg.: pandemics, environmental disasters, gas leaks, forest fires, traffic accidents..) – while today’s systems are still lacking efficient prevention and protection!
Human vision cannot be in place 24/7 to catch these events. Recognising them locally, fast or even proactively using our visual senses is crucial for preventing and reducing damage right at the beginning.

Today’s world offers many possibilities of cameras capturing live videos or pictures everywhere around the globe. Local processing power and AI are evolving as the technology advances. Reacting immediately brings big potential to save lives and protect our environment.

Take up this challenge to create a safer world! Think of possible use cases to prototype while utilizing these features. Good hacking!

Give a voice to the AI language assistant of the future!
We all need corporate assistance now and then. It can be about asking for advice, troubleshooting or other kind of assistance. But what are the characteristics and features of the perfect channel? Which touchpoints are desired, which are useful and beneficial from a customer-centric view - and which are not?

Take up this challenge and figure out how Conversional Assistants based on Artificial Intelligence (Deep Learning) can be taken to the next level - with focus on benefits for customers (callers)! You will get access to evaluated prototyping-tools as well as experiences, data and experts of a startup in the field of customer support with more than 60k successful calls.

Join the game of paper records: spice up online receipts!
If you think about doing your tax refund or saving receipts for guarantee reasons, you might not be overwhelmed by a wave of motivation. Transferring physical paperwork into the digital sphere adds security to the process, however, it’s certainly not the embodiment of fun! Hence, we aim at making scanning receipts sexy!
Ready to join us on the mission of motivating users to digitize receipts by integrating gamification to the process?

A must-have are functions to scan and store receipts as well as to share them with others and get statistics - everything else is up to you!
